             <h3>When Porsche unveiled the 918 Spyder concept at the 2010 Geneva
                  Motor Show we were all in amazement. Within that amazement was
                   a sense of a sense of pessimism, as we were unsure exactly how
                    this future successor to the Carrera GT would look and run in 
                    the real world. We all know that manufacturers have a habit of
                     “overestimating” its cars at these shows, to put it nicely.
                    <hr>
                    After more than three years, the 918 Spyder ended its testing 
                    phase and is ready for its world debut at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor
                     Show. The 918 has made many passes around the “Green Hell,” thrashing
                      its predecessor’s time in the process. All of these laps around the 
                      famed Nürburgring and at Porsche’s test facilities have given the 
                      automaker enough details to allow it to piece together all of its specs.
                      <hr>
                      The Porsche 918 Spyder is a monumentally fast machine. Rocking a 4.6-liter
                       V-8 internal combustion engine paired with a dual set of electric motors
                        and seven-speed PDK transmission, this German monster lays down upwards
                         of 887 horsepower and 940 pound-feet of torque.
