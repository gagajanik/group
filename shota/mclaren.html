             <h3>The P1 features a 3.8 L; 231.8 cu in (3,799 cc) twin-turbocharged V8 engine.
                 [14] The twin turbos boost the petrol engine at 1.4 bar (20.3 psi) to deliver
                  737 PS (542 kW; 727 hp) at 7,500 rpm and 531 lb⋅ft (720 N⋅m) of torque at 4,000 rpm,
                  combined with an in-house-developed electric motor producing 179 PS (132 kW; 177 hp)
                  and 192 lb⋅ft (260 N⋅m) of torque. The electric motor and the petrol engine in the P1,
                  produce a combined power output of 916 PS (674 kW; 903 hp) and 723 lb⋅ft (980 N⋅m)
                  of torque.[15] The electric motor can be deployed manually by the driver or left
                  in automatic mode, whereby the car's ECUs 'torque fill' the gaps in the petrol 
                  engine's output, which is considered turbo lag.
                   <hr>
                     This gives the powertrain an effective powerband of almost 7,000 rpm.[16] The car is
                     rear-wheel-drive with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission developed by Graziano.
                     Power for the electric motor is stored in a 324-cell lithium-ion high-density
                     battery pack located behind the cabin, developed by Johnson Matthey Battery Systems.
                     The battery can be charged by the engine or through a plug-in equipment and can be
                     fully charged in two hours. The car can be operated using either the petrol engine,
                     the electric motor or with a combination of the two. The P1 has an all-electric
                     range of at least 10 km (6.2 mi) on the combined European drive cycle.[17] Under
                     the EPA cycle, the range in EV mode is 19 mi (31 km). During EV mode the P1 has
                     a petrol consumption of 4.8g/100 mile, and as a result, EPA's all-electric
                     range is rated as zero. 
                    <hr>
                       According to McLaren the P1 accelerates from 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) in 2.8 seconds,
                        0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.8 seconds, and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 16.5 seconds,
                        making it a full 5.5 seconds faster than the F1, and a standing quarter mile is
                        claimed in 9.8 seconds at 152 mph (245 km/h).[21] Autocar tested 0–60 mph 
                        (0–97 km/h) mph in 2.8 seconds, 0–120 mph (0–193 km/h) mph in 6.9 seconds,
                        the standing quarter mile in 10.2 seconds at 147.5 mph (237 km/h), and the
                        standing kilometre in 18.2 seconds at 178.5 mph (287 km/h).[22] The P1 is
                        electronically limited to a top speed of 217 mph (350 km/h). The P1 has a dry 
                        weight of 1,395 kg (3,075 lb), giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 
                        647 bhp/tonne.
