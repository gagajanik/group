             <h3>Ferrari once again produces an iconic, praise-worthy 
                 automobile that beckons any enthusiast its way. Not only
                  is the LaFerrari one of the highest performance road cars 
                  Ferrari has ever produced, but it couples its 6.3-liter V12
                   with a 161 horsepower hybrid system. With a combined 949 
                   horsepower and over 663 pound-feet of torque, the 2016
                   <hr>
                    Ferrari LaFerrari specs top its cutting-edge engineering 
                    with efficiency, power, and stunning design. Driving a 
                    LaFerrari is an experience unto itself. If the high-voltage
                     battery is charged, it will shut down the V12 under light load.
                      Manually shifting the 7-speed transmission offers instant gratification,
                       but shifting isn’t really necessary.

                        That’s because this car makes power in any gear at any rpm. A machine 
                        designed to take the tarmac wherever it goes and at whatever particular 
                        pace, the batteries even recharge under braking, making track day all the
                         more tempting.
