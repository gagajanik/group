                <h3>&nbsp;Early life</h3>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal_Gadot" style="color:white">&nbsp;&nbsp;wiki</a></p>
                <p> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Gal Gadot was born in Petah Tikva, Israel, and raised in its neighbouring city of Rosh
                    HaAyin. In Hebrew, her first name means "wave" and her surname means &nbsp;&nbsp;"riverbanks".
                    Her parents are Irit (née Weiss), a teacher, and Michael Gadot, an engineer. 
                    Both her parents were born in Israel, and they Hebraized their surname from &nbsp;&nbsp;"Greenstein" 
                    to "Gadot" prior to her birth. Her father is a sixth-generation Israeli. Her
                    maternal grandparents were born in Europe; her grandfather, who was &nbsp;&nbsp;imprisoned in the
                    Auschwitz concentration camp, survived the Holocaust, and her grandmother left before 
                    the Nazi invasion. Gadot has stated that she was brought &nbsp;&nbsp;up in a "very 
                    Jewish, Israeli family environment". Her ancestry is Polish-Jewish, Austrian-Jewish,
                    German-Jewish, and Czech-Jewish. She has one younger sister.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Her high school major was biology. She says that in high school she was good at basketball
                    because of her height. As a teenager, her first jobs were babysitting and at &nbsp;&nbsp;Burger 
                    King. As an adult, Gadot studied law and international relations at the IDC Herzliya 
                    college.
                        
                    Gadot completed her two mandatory years of service in the Israel &nbsp;&nbsp;Defense Forces, enlisted 
                    as a combat instructor. She said of her time in the Israeli military: "You give two or 
                    three years, and it's not about you. You learn discipline &nbsp;&nbsp;and respect." Gadot says that 
                    her background helped her to win the role of Gisele in Fast & Furious: "I think the main 
                    reason was that the director Justin Lin really &nbsp;&nbsp;liked that I was in the military, and he 
                    wanted to use my knowledge of weapons."

                <h3>&nbsp;Modeling and pageant career</h3>
                <p>     
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;At age 18, Gadot won the 2004 Miss Israel beauty pageant and next competed in the 
                        Miss Universe 2004 pageant in Ecuador. She carried out her mandatory two-year &nbsp;&nbsp;military 
                        service from the age of 20, then studied law.

                        Gadot has led international campaigns as a model for Miss Sixty, Huawei smartphones, 
                        Captain Morgan rum, &nbsp;&nbsp;Gucci fragrances and Vine Vera skincare ranges, and Jaguar Cars. 
                        In 2015, she became the face of Gucci's Bamboo perfume brand. She has been featured 
                        as the &nbsp;&nbsp;covergirl on Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Bride Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, UMM, 
                        Cleo, Fashion, Lucire, FHM. Gadot has been the main model for fashion brand &nbsp;&nbsp;Castro in 
                        2008–16. In 2013, her combined annual modelling and acting salary was estimated at 
                        NIS 2.4 million, which was ahead of a number of other famous Israeli &nbsp;&nbsp;models such as Esti 
                        Ginzburg and Shlomit Malka, though significantly behind Bar Refaeli.
                        
                        In 2007, 21-year-old Gadot was in the Maxim photo shoot, "Women of the &nbsp;&nbsp;IDF", and was 
                        then featured on the cover of the New York Post. In April 2012, Shalom Life ranked her 
                        Number 5 on its list of "the 50 most talented, intelligent, &nbsp;&nbsp;funny, and gorgeous Jewish 
                        women in the world", behind model Bar Refaeli and actress Eva Green. In 2014, Gadot 
                        was one of two Israeli actresses, along with &nbsp;&nbsp;Odeya Rush, listed as an upcoming leading 
                        lady by InStyle magazine.
